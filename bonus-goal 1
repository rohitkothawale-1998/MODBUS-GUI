Stretch Goal #1 (Bonus 1):
  It will be really nice to reach further with the MPS system running parameters, often times, they are accessed (Read or Write) from the SGR Power Manager SW. 
  I wish we can create necessary GUI entries for read and write of those registers. 
  It will be used for setting (just a quick example), such as:
    The audio buzzer 
    System level warnings
    User defined Runtime parameters, such as the Upper limit of the Diesel generator Threshold (stop of the gen), or, the lower threlhold (for turning on the generator)
