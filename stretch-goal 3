Stretch Goal #3 (Bonus 3):
  FW upload (indeed the current code has snippets in there for file loading and file dissemenation, and file xfer over the serial port)
    -"Talk" to the Bootloader (we might need to consult SGR or our Engineers at Shanghai)
    -Make a file selector (already done the current code)
    -then, upload the BIN File over to the serial port.
